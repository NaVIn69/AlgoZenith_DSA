during recursive code
// first find  what is the level
// then choice
// check
//move
.. place
.. recursive move
..unplace

find how many parameter in recursive function we need to solve the problem
// there is always one variable/DATA STRUCTURE which is going to shared across the all recursive code 
// always write what is the defanition of your function

// do the Dry run on some of the test case
